In the context of machine learning and deep learning, tensors are the primary data structures used to represent and manipulate data.\n","\n","## Mathematical Definition\n","\n","Mathematically, a tensor is a multidimensional array of numerical values that transforms according to certain rules under a change of coordinates. More formally:\n","\n","- A **0-dimensional tensor** is a scalar (a single number)\n","- A **1-dimensional tensor** is a vector\n","- A **2-dimensional tensor** is a matrix\n","- **Higher-dimensional tensors** (3D, 4D, etc.) are the generalization of these concepts\n","\n","## Tensor Properties\n","\n","Every tensor has three key properties:\n","\n","1. **Rank (or Order)**: The number of dimensions (axes) of the tensor\n","   - Scalar: rank-0\n","   - Vector: rank-1\n","   - Matrix: rank-2\n","   - Higher dimensions: rank-3, rank-4, etc.\n","\n","2. **Shape**: The size along each dimension (e.g., a 3×4 matrix has shape [3,4])\n","\n","3. **Data Type**: The type of elements contained in the tensor (e.g., float32, int64)\n","\n","## Tensors in Machine Learning\n","\n","In machine learning, tensors serve several critical functions:\n","\n","### 1. Data Representation\n","- **Images**: Typically represented as 3D tensors (height × width × color channels)\n","- **Video**: 4D tensors (frames × height × width × channels)\n","- **Text**: Often represented as 2D tensors (sequences × embedding dimension)\n","\n","### 2. Model Parameters\n","- The weights and biases in neural networks are stored as tensors\n","- For example, a dense layer with 256 inputs and 128 outputs is represented by a weight matrix (tensor) of shape [256, 128]\n","\n","### 3. Operations\n","- All mathematical operations in deep learning (matrix multiplications, convolutions, etc.) are performed on tensors\n","- Modern frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are optimized for efficient tensor operations\n","\n","## Common Tensor Operations\n","\n","1. **Element-wise operations**: Operations applied independently to each element\n","2. **Broadcasting**: Automatic expansion of tensors during operations\n","3. **Reduction operations**: Operations that reduce dimensionality (sum, mean, etc.)\n","4. **Dot products and matrix multiplications**\n","5. **Tensor reshaping**: Changing the shape without altering the data\n","6. **Transposition**: Swapping dimensions\n","\n","## Tensor Implementation in ML Frameworks\n","\n","### In TensorFlow:\n","```python\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","# Create a tensor\n","tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n","# Perform operations\n","result = tf.matmul(tensor, tensor)\n","```\n","\n","### In PyTorch:\n","```python\n","import torch\n","# Create a tensor\n","tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n","# Perform operations\n","result = torch.mm(tensor, tensor)\n","```\n","\n","## Why Tensors Matter in Machine Learning\n","\n","1. **Efficient computation**: Tensors enable vectorized operations that can be accelerated on GPUs/TPUs\n","2. **Unified representation**: All data and parameters can be expressed as tensors\n","3. **Automatic differentiation**: Frameworks can automatically compute gradients through tensor operations\n","4. **Hardware optimization**: Modern hardware is designed to process tensor operations efficiently.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4Ib9Slbid8Qz"}}]}
